 * Auth header helper.
 *
 * After the Authentik forward_auth migration the browser no longer carries a
 * Bearer token — Caddy authenticates the request via the `authentik_session`
 * cookie and forwards the user identity to the backend as `X-Authentik-*`
 * headers. Browser fetches just need to include credentials so the cookie
 * travels with the request.
 *
 * This stub remains so legacy callers compile; it always returns `null`.
